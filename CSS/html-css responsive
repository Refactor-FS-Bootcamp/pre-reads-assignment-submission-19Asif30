                <b>lightning</b>, the visible <b>discharge of electricity</b> that occurs when a region of a cloud acquires an excess electrical charge, either positive or negative, that is sufficient to break down the <b>resistance of air.</b>

            <p class = "para2">
                <b>Lightning</b> is usually associated with <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds (thunderclouds), but it also occurs in <b>stratiform</b> clouds (layered clouds with a large horizontal extent), in snowstorms and dust storms, and sometimes in the dust and gases emitted by erupting <b>volcanoes.</b> During a thunderstorm, lightning can occur within the cloud, between clouds, between the cloud and the air, or between the cloud and the ground.
